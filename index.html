                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div class="well">
                  <p>I am a hard worker with an easy-going personality who enjoys being part of a team and collaborating on projects.
                    I am serious about my work but always keep a sense of humor about myself. I have quite a varied background and work
                    history. I did very well in High School but skipped college to enter the trades as a Marine Pipefitter apprentice
                    at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. A year after graduating I was laid off and began pursuing music seriously.
                    While pursuing music I took a job at Merrill Lynch working in their 401k Fullfillment Center. Soon I moved into
                    managing the department. About a year later our entire office was closed and I was again layed off. Luckily a
                    full time music opportunity presented itself at the righ time. For the next 10 years I worked producing jingles
                    and custom music for television and radio with IQ Beats and Big Idea Music. After 10 years doing well in the industry
                    I could see that it was becoming oversaturated with producers and devalued. That's when I began looking at a career
                    change and ultimately decided to learn computer programming. That and a friend's recommendation is what lead me to Epicodus.</p>
